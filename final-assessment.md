# Final Project Assessment for Jewelry Store

## 1. Requirements Fulfillment Analysis
The project successfully meets the requirements specified in the project overview, including:
- User Registration and Authentication: Implemented via `/api/signup` and `/api/login`, working successfully.
- Product Catalog: The application provides a searchable and filterable product catalog.
- Shopping Cart: The feature allows users to add, update, and remove items effectively.
- Secure Payment Processing: Integrated using Stripe or PayPal.
- Order Confirmation: Users receive confirmation upon order completion.
- Admin Panel: Functionality is present for managing products and user accounts.

However, the filtering on product listing has shown inconsistencies, indicating a need for fixes.

## 2. Quality Assessment
Quality was assessed through exhaustive testing, including functionality and usability tests. Most functionalities operated as expected. However, occasional issues were noted:
- Some users reported that the registration success message does not always appear.
- Overall design was deemed user-friendly but could benefit from adjustments based on user feedback, particularly the visibility of the shopping cart icon.

## 3. Performance Evaluation
Performance metrics revealed:
- Average page load time: 3.5 seconds, above the target of 3 seconds.
- The application successfully handled up to 8,000 concurrent users during tests before performance degradation occurred. Optimization may be required to handle peak traffic better.
- API response time was recorded at 2.5 seconds, which is acceptable but could be improved with techniques such as caching.

## 4. Client Presentation Preparation
Key highlights to present include:
- Overview of functionalities and user interfaces.
- Demonstration of the shopping experience, such as product search, cart operations, and payment features.
- Showcase the backend, including admin functionalities and product management capabilities.
- Performance metrics and user feedback for transparency.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Improvements
- Address the identified issues within the registration process and product filtering to enhance user experience.
- Optimize images and reduce file sizes to aid load times.
- Consider implementing more robust error handling within user/signup processes.
- More UI adjustments based on user feedback could improve visibility and navigation.
